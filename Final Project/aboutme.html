		<h2>Life is like a mountain unmovable, but with proper preparation the summit is always obtainable.<br>
		-Robert Long III</h2>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>Hello, my name is Robert Long III. I am working on obtaining my associates of applied science. I love computers and science so naturally computer science is one of my favorite things to past time. I plan on going back and majoring as a software engineer. <br>
		<br>
		I have grown up in the era of major technological boom so as a kid I have always been very interesting in technology. Computers and designing things are one of my passions along with helping others and animals. I always loved the joy it brings when you help someone who is in need of a helping hand.<br>
		<br>
		Some of my hobbies include sports, video games, movies, tv shows, and spending time with loved ones. I always keep up with sports namely NFL, NBA, and MLB, but I enjoy anything with competition. Some of my favorite movies include Pulp Fiction, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and Paid in Full. One of my favorite things to do to relax is watch some tv shows.</p>
