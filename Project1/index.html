	<h2>Hello, My name is Robert!</h2>
	<p>My "Three Things Project", is implementing most of the things I have learned during my time in CSIT 121.

		<br>
	This site was hand-coded in sublime text editor. I used standard html attached with a CSS file. I tried to make the site accesible and easy to follow with contrasting colors and backgrounds.</p>
