	<h2>Video Games!</h2>
	<p>As stated before I love competition, and another form of competition is video games. I have been around video games my entire life and have always loved them. However, when I was a kid you only could play with the people directly in the same room. With the boom of technology has opened many options to play with friends where ever you may be in the world. It is also a great way to stay connected to friends.</p>
